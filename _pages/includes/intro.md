<span id="about-me"></span>

I work at NUDT as an Associate Professor now in China. I'm also an Associate Editor for IEEE RA-L, ICRA, and IROS

My research topics are Robotics, Localization, Mapping, SLAM, Robot Learning, Visual and LiDAR Perception, Rescue Robots. 

I obtained my Ph.D. with thesis entiled “Exploration and Mapping with Mobile Robots” ([website](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/10228)), supervised by [Cyrill Stachniss](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/cyrill-stachniss/index.html) at the University of Bonn, Germany. I was a member of the Technical Committee of RoboCup Rescue Robot League ([RRL](https://rrl.robocup.org/)).
Here is my extended CV [[(pdf)]()].

I am founded by Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST ([website](http://english.cast.org.cn/)). I was selected as Robotics: Science and Systems Poineer (30 candidates worldwide each year) and one of my papers was a finalist for the Best System Paper by Robotics: Science and Systems (3 candidates worldwide each year). I won six times Best in Class and winner in international rescue robot competitions. I have published 70+ peer-reviewed dacademic papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DvrngV4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FChen-Xieyuanli%2Fmy-home@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international robotics journal and conferences, such as TRO, TITS, RAL, RSS, ICRA, IROS and CVPR.
